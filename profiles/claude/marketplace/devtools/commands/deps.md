Audit project dependencies for outdated packages, security vulnerabilities, and unused imports.

1. Check for outdated packages using the project's package manager
2. Run a security audit (npm audit, pip-audit, cargo audit, etc.)
3. Scan for unused dependencies in the codebase
4. Summarize findings in a table with severity levels
